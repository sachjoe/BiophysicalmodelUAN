Urothelial Afferent Neurons: Implications for
Sensory Signalling in Urinary Bladder' -Aruljothi & Manchanda


NEURON in Windows
1. Locate and launch NEURON'S mknrndll tool from the Windows start menu. 
Use the "Choose Directory" option to get to the model folder's location. 
Click "List Dir" and then "Make nrnmech.dll" when you get to the model folder.
All the mod files in this directory are assembled using this.

Systems based on Unix
1. Using the terminal, navigate (change directory) to the model folder. 
2. Use the terminal to call "nrnivmodl" (without the inverted commas) to compile the mod files. 
3. Use the command "nrngui mosinit.hoc" to start the model.

For systems running MacOS
putting together mod files Observe the directions provided here: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/nmodl/macos.html 
2. Run the model by typing "nrngui mosinit.hoc" into the command line. 

The folders are labelled according to the figure numbers 
mentioned in the paper

In windows system after compiling the 'mod' files,
